<p><h4>Background:</h4></p>
    <p>Vanderbilt University's R Working Group is established through the univeristy's library system. The purpose of this group is to address data-related needs of faculty and students on campus. In this group, we seek to educate...</p>
    <p><h4>Structure:</h4></p>
    <p>We welcome learners of all skill levels and programmatic backgrounds. It is recommended, if you do not have a foundation in R, to attend an "Introduction to R/RStudio" lesson (see calendar for details) to help you get started. 
    <p>Our Fall 2018 calendar is structured in a scaffolded learning style, meaning, lessons build on each other. As a group we will be working through Hadley Wickham and Garret Grolemund's book <a href="http://r4ds.had.co.nz/">"R For Data Science."</a></p> 
    <p>Like R langugage, the book is open source and can be accessed online for free. <b>Please do not feel pressured to opt out of a lesson because you are unable to attend a workshop.</b> We are a community of learners: Instructors and peers will be happy to help you get caught up to speed.</p>
  <p>To help with sustainability, we ask for student volunteers to help co-teach lessons during our regular lessons. This is a great way to add teaching experience to your resume! Students can volunteer to help lead a class by contacting an instructor during class or by reaching out to commodorgroup@gmail.com.</p>
  <p>"R For Data Science" uses sample datasets for exercises (e.g., iris and cars datasets). To have a more "authentic" experience, we seek to use topical datasets to learn with. If you are a faculty or student who knows of an interesting dataset our group can collectively "hack", please get in touch.</p>
  <p><h4>Community Code of Conduct:</h4></p>
  <p>See our Community Code of Conduct. If you do not agree with the code, this group is not a fit for you.</p>

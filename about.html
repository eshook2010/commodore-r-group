<p><h4>Background:</h4></p>
    <p>Vanderbilt University's R Working Group is established through the univeristy's library system. In this group, we seek to supply learners with a foundational knowledge of the R programming language. Vanderbilt's R Working Group is created by Meredith Broadway, Data Analysis Librarian at Walker Management Library.</p>
    <p><h4>Structure:</h4></p>
    <p>We welcome learners of all skill levels and programmatic backgrounds. It is recommended, if you do not have a foundation in R, to attend an "Introduction to R/RStudio" lesson (see <a href="https://commodore-r-group.github.io/calendar">calendar</a> for details) to help you get started. 
    <p>Our Fall 2019 calendar is not a structured in a scaffolded learning style, meaning, lessons will not build on each other. You are not required to have attended a previous lessons.</a></p> 
    <p><b>Please do not feel pressured to opt out of a lesson because you are unable to attend a workshop.</b> We are a community of learners: Instructors and peers will be happy to help you get caught up to speed.</p>
  <p>To help with sustainability, we ask for student volunteers to help co-teach lessons during our regular lessons. This is a great way to add teaching experience to your resume! Students can volunteer to help lead a class by contacting an instructor during class or by reaching out to commodorgroup@gmail.com.</p>
  <p><h4>Community Code of Conduct:</h4></p>
